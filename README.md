Welcome!
This is the milestone project from the User Centric Frontend Design module for CodeInstitute.

What the project does-
This is a starting website for a freelance dog behaviorist who gives advice and works remotely.
The website title does not focus just on the behaviors as leaves room to expand into other topics with regards to dogs such as sports with dogs, dog diets, travelling with dogs etc.
The need it fulfills-
To offer tips and advice to dog owners regarding dog behavior.
How the website is setup-
The body of the website is setup with a navigation bar at the top, followed by an introduction container that includes the website banner and website title.
There is a content section underneath the introduction container on every page, which has different content on each page.
The section on the home page has been split into two and includes a tip of the day along with a picture showing a simple dog trick.
The section on the about page has been split into three to show the behaviorist and the two dogs used to show training.
The section on the videos page has been split into two which shows the tricks shown in the video and an example video showing what training is capable of.
The section on the training tips page has been split into two and shows the same training tip and simple dog trick as the home page, followed by three more training tips and three more pictures showing simple dog tricks.
The section on the contact page contains a contact form to get in touch with the behaviorist to seek more individual advice for more specific dog behavior cases.
The footer contains the copyright of the websites to the behaviorist along with the social links to the behaviorists social media.(The social links can be changed once the website social media is set up)


Extras-
There is a hidden youtube link in place for when the youtube channel is set up in the future.
